# Capstone Project - Conference Page

- Follow these [design guidelines](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015).
- Personalize the content of your page.
- Use Lato font family.
- Build 2 pages:
> - The home page.
> - The about page.
- Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:
> - Mobile: up to 768px wide.
> - Desktop: 768px or wider.
- Links
> - The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
> - The logo in the header links to the home page.
- Mobile menu
> - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
> - Mobile menu should be consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
> - The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.
- Dynamic page
> - The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
> - You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
- Give credit to the design author in the README.md file
- Additional requirements
> - implement some UX improvements: add the "More" button on the home page, include transitions and/or animations.
> - implement the tickets page and the schedule page.
